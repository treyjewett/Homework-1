# Horiseon Digital Marketing

## The Project

A digital marketing company was in need of an upgrade to their website. The code was repetitive, did not flow correctly, and did not function as well as it could have. In order for a business to survive, they need to have a website that is as great as the product they are delivering.

## Issues

From the start, the HTML file was very wordy. Almost every child had its own class and that just made everything look very messy. A number of tags did not have closing tags and some closing tags did not belong to an opening tag. The CSS was also quite a mess. The file did not follow the flow of the HTML at all. Elements at the bottom of the webpage were getting formatted before some of the elements at the top. Because of all the classes made in the HTML, the CSS was much longer and wordier than it needed to be. For example, a different class was given to each card, eventhough they were formatted exactly the same. All of the images (in their respective parent) were formatted the same way, but were given different format instructions in the CSS. Finally, there was absolutely no commenting or meta data, and this is for a digital marketing company!
